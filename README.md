The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning method employed to tackle classification and regression problems. Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges developed this algorithm in 1951, which was subsequently expanded by Thomas Cover. The article explores the fundamentals, workings, and implementation of the KNN algorithm.
Why do we need a KNN algorithm?
(K-NN) algorithm is a versatile and widely used machine learning algorithm that is primarily used for its simplicity and ease of implementation. It does not require any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It can also handle both numerical and categorical data, making it a flexible choice for various types of datasets in classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the similarity of data points in a given dataset. K-NN is less sensitive to outliers compared to other algorithms.

The K-NN algorithm works by finding the K nearest neighbors to a given data point based on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. The class or value of the data point is then determined by the majority vote or average of the K neighbors. This approach allows the algorithm to adapt to different patterns and make predictions based on the local structure of the data.
